								<h2 class="major">Nitaf Bar</h2>
								<p>Hi, I’m Nitaf, my student number is s3717378 and I was born in Israel but have lived in Australia for almost 13 years. I speak fluent English and Hebrew. My favourite pastimes include playing computer games and occasionally going to the gym. Additionally, I am interested in learning about new innovations in technology such as AI, robotics or virtual/augmented reality. I currently have limited IT experience in Java and Visual Basic programming but I wish to broaden my knowledge of IT for the future.</p>
								<p>My Personality test results:
								</br><b>Myers-Briggs:</b> 
								</br>ISFJ-A. Role: Sentinel, The Defender.
								</br><b>Learning Styles:</b>
								</br>Visual Learner.
								</br>Visual - 50%
								</br>Auditory - 30%
								</br>Tactile - 20%
								</br><b>Big Five Personality:</b>
								</br>Openness: Low - 37.5%		
								</br>Conscientiousness: Moderate - 62.5%							
								</br>Extraversion: Low - 33%							 		
								</br>Agreeableness: Moderate - 71%							 	
								</br>Neuroticism: Low - 35%</p>
								<p>What the results mean for the team:
								</br>The outcomes of my three test results will provide my group with an understanding of how to best communicate with me and what type of work I can complete to best support my team. According to the big five personality test results my low score in neuroticism means that I am less likely to be moody or suffer from worry, anxiety and frustration. This could potentially assist my group as I can help keep everyone on track.
								Furthermore, somebody with the “defender” personality such as myself is described as one who can always be relied on to get the job done. This attribute can benefit my team as I will be able to focus on the tasks at hand and hopefully push the rest of my group members to complete high quality group work in an enthusiastic manner.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Linus Cheung</h2>
								<p>My name is Linus Cheung and my student number is s3717624. I was born in Hong Kong and moved to Australia when I was very young. I attended McKinnon Secondary College for high school and completed VCE in 2017. My hobbies include playing video games, listening to music and cooking. I’ve always been interested in technology due to always being around computers. I have some knowledge in coding and developing programs as I took Software Development in VCE and have been self-learning for a while.</p>
								<p>My Personality test results:
								</br><b>Myers-Briggs:</b>
								</br>ISFJ-A. Role: Sentinel, The Defender.
								</br><b>Learning styles - VARK:</b>
								</br>Multimodal Learning Preference
								</br>Visual: 9
								</br>Aural: 4
								</br>Read/Write: 7
								</br>Kinesthetic: 7
								</br><b>Big Five Personality:</b>
								</br>Openness: Low - 46%		
								</br>Conscientiousness: Moderate - 58%						
								</br>Extraversion: Low - 17%							 	
								</br>Agreeableness: Moderate - 71%							
								</br>Neuroticism: Moderate - 60%</p>
								<p>How these results may be helpful to the team:
								</br>The results of the Myers-Briggs test illustrates myself as a more quiet but supportive member of the team. By being a more supportive member, it accentuates the fact that I am a more patient and meticulous person, willing to contribute to meaningful discussions. This can help with building on other teammates ideas and being thorough to ensure that these ideas are the best possible for the team overall. With a high agreeableness, I am able to balance my own interests along with the interests of others in order to avoid conflict.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Jeff Ma</h2>
								<p>Hello! My name is Jeff Ma, student s3717795 at RMIT, and am an Australian born Chinese. I am able to speak English and limited Chinese, as well as dialect. I attended Mckinnon Secondary College and am now enrolled at RMIT to further expand my IT knowledge. In my free time I enjoy playing games and eating delicious foods. My IT interest began when I was young and messing around with the computer at home when my family wasn’t using it. From this interest I have completed Software Development class at secondary school and hope to expand on this at RMIT to be equipped with skills to work in the industry.</p>

								<p>What the results mean for the team:
								</br>The results of the tests show that I am a logical and social person supported by The Myer-Briggs results displaying high levels of extraversion and observation. These traits in a team setting allow me to effectively communicate with peers and quickly gain experience and familiarity with tasks at hand to benefit efficiency and prompt discussion ideas.

								<h2 class="major">Christos Tartiris</h2>
								<p>Hello, my name is Christos Tartiris and my student number is s3717919. I was born in Greece but I have been living in Australia for over 7 years. I can fully speak read and write both Greek and English. I finished school at McKinnon Secondary College. Some of my hobbies are cars and playing computer games. I also played soccer for over 5 years. My interest in IT and technology started from a young age when I interested about computers and gaming. My current knowledge in IT is low however, I hope to gain the skills and knowledge that give me a good start to a career in the industry.</p>
								<p>My personality test results:
								</br><b>Myers-Briggs:</b>
								</br>ISFJ-A. Role: Sentinel, The Defender.
								</br><b>Learning styles:</b>
								</br>Auditory: 15%
								</br>Visual: 40%
								</br>Tactile: 45%
								</br><b>Big Five Personality:</b>
								</br>Extroversion: 22 score percentile
								</br>Emotional stability: 78 score percentile 
								</br>Agreeableness: 35 score percentile
								</br>Conscientiousness: 67 score percentile
								</br>Intellect/Imagination: 6 score percentile</p>
								<p>What the results mean for the team: 
								</br>The results of the few learning style and personality tests that I took show that I have high a emotional stability as I found out through The Big Five Personality test. This means that while working in a team environment I will be able to have clear thinking and to be able to control my emotions which therefore means, that I will be able to keep my team focused on completing the task. Also with a high score in conscientiousness, it is crucial that I keep the team under control and be careful with each decision that we agree on. It will also help the team as this trait implies that I have the desire to complete a task well and to take obligations of other team members seriously, while I also tend to be efficient, organized and easy-going which would all help in a team me work well in a team environment. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Kevin Nguyen</h2>
								<p>Hey, my name is Kevin Nguyen (s3719491). I am Vietnamese, but born and raised in Australia and as a result, speak English and little Vietnamese. I attended Albion North Primary School for all my primary life and then went on to study at Braybrook College. I like to play games with friends and attempt to cook in my free time. My interest for IT goes back to when I was a young child playing on my computer. I wanted to know how computers worked and learn what I can do myself with just a computer. Currently I have small amounts of knowledge in IT but hope to build on what I have in the future.</p>
								<p>My personality test results:
								</br><b>Myers-Briggs:</b>
								</br>ISFP-T. Role: Explorer, The Adventurer
								</br><b>Learning Style:</b>
								</br>Auditory Learner
								</br>Auditory 50%
								</br>Visual 35%
								</br>Tactile 15%
								</br><b>Big Five Personalities: </b>
								</br>Empathic Idealist
								</br>Practical Caretaker
								</br>Analytical Thinker
								</br>Logical Mechanic</p>
								<p>What the results mean for the team:
								</br>The Myers-Briggs results shows that I am a creative person. This can help with providing a different perspective on what the team wants to accomplish, which can benefit the team as a different perspective could be needed for a problem the rest of the team can’t understand. Being an analytical thinker only solidifies this point. I am mostly an empathic idealist though, implicating me as a good helper. This can benefit the team as it means that I can help others with problems they may face or help someone acquire a new skill. </p>
